# Electoral Data Project - Current Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Electoral Data Issues
- **Problem**: All states in 2020 (and other years) were showing uniform party results
- **Root Cause**: Data processing script was ignoring individual state party data + corrupted party assignments in raw data
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed processing logic to read each state's individual party data
  - Corrected 302 incorrectly assigned party values in raw CSV
  - Verified all elections now show proper state-by-state variety

### 2. Added Complete 2024 Election Data
- **Added**: All 50 states + DC with correct 2024 election results
- **Results**: Trump 312 EVs (31 states), Harris 226 EVs (20 states)  
- **Verified**: All 7 battleground states correctly show Trump victories
- **Party Assignments**: Fixed and validated for accuracy
- **Population Data**: Complete 2024 Census Bureau estimates for all 51 jurisdictions
- **Total US Population 2024**: 340,092,578

### 3. Established Single Source of Truth Architecture
- **Root Datasource**: `data/raw/electoral_enhanced.csv`
- **Coverage**: Complete data from 1789-2024 (60 election years, 2,360 records)
- **Processing Pipeline**: Single script generates all JSON outputs
- **Validation**: Automated checks ensure data integrity
